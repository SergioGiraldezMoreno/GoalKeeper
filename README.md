# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Because this project uses firebase and its configuration is private, this option won't work properly.\
To see the UI visit: [this url](https://goalkeeper-817a7.web.app/).

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

As some of the files needed to build are private and not published on Github this option won't work properly.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
